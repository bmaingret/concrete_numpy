# Trying out Zama's concrete

Using an example from scikit-learn and comparing it to using concrete.

## Source

* [scikit-learn example](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html)
* [Concrete Numpy](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete-numpy/stable/user/basics/intro.html)

N.B. This starting out as trying `concrete.numpy` but ending in not using for the linear regression. Only `concrete.quantization` module was used.
